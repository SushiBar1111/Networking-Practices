# Networking-Practices
My own personal repository of network practices that i have done. This practices mainly from Jeremy's IT Lab CCNA 200-301 Free Course on Youtube. Thanks to Jeremy for these practice labs to sharpen my skill.

This repository structure is each practice day will have its own folder. The name will be like Day # - Subject/What am i practicing. 
Inside the folder, it consist of the .pkt file of the practice question and my answer, network documentation (in .txt), and screenshot of the .pkt file.
The screenshot image intended so that you don't have to download the .pkt file to see the question and my answer (network topology).
